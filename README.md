## Iteration One
During this iteration we knocked out mostly essentials. Many of our user stories could not be satisfied without some essential code being done first, like making the activities communicate with each other which is what we worked on first. Then, we worked on the movement of the character, collecting the items, the main menu, and the upgrade menu, all of which satisfy user stories.

We implemented and wrote tests for:
- As a player that is moving I want to harvest items I collide with so that I have things to sell.
- As a player I want to not go off the games map so that I can continue to play the game.
- As a player that controls the character when I swipe I want to change directions so that I can control which way I move.
- As a player seeking fun I want to be able to access menus so that I can play the game.

Getting the initial Canvas SurfaceView and threading set up was a pain, as well as simulating touch input for the tests, but fortunately we were able to find code online to get us started with it.
Refactoring some of the tests and the way input is handled as well as adding a main game class may be in order for a future iteration.
