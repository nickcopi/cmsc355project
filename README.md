During this iteration we knocked out mostly essentials. Many of our user stories could not be satisfied without some essential code being done first, like making the activities communicate with each other which is what we worked on first. Then, we worked on the movement of the character, collecting the items, the main menu, and the upgrade menu, all of which satisfy user stories.
